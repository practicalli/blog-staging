    <p>The London Clojurian community started in 2010 when Robert Rees tricked Bruce Durling into organsing monthly events. From those humble beginnings the community has grown close to 4,000 members with several monthly events taking place fairly consistently over the last 13 years.</p><p>The community has thrived due to the hard work of a great many people and this article probably misses out on a lot of activities (especially in the early years).</p><p>I steped down as one of the main organisers having delegated most of the work to many other people.  The last decade of community work has been very rewarding, but its time for other to continue the work.  I now focus on the <a href="https://practical.li/">Practicalli websites</a> for learning and using Clojure effectively.</p><p>[Sponsorship Banner]</p><!-- more --><h2 id="in-the-beginning-there-was-code-dojo">In the beginning there was Code dojo</h2><p>Code dojos are a great place to practice and learn new aspects of Clojure language and its wide community of libraries.</p><p>The premise of the dojo was to <strong>raise everyones experience with Clojure</strong> with a side goal of eating all the pizza generously provides by Thoughtworks (a few times we had sandwiches and queche instead, which was a nice change)</p><p>The dojo events were initially quite daunting, with two people pairing (one with some experience with Clojure hopefully) whilst everyone else watched.  Then the pairs would switch.  The aim was to gradually evolve a single project, specifially a text-based adventure game called Clork (Zork in Clojure).</p><blockquote><p><a href="https://github.com/ldnclj/clork">Clork project</a> is on the London Clojurian GitHub repository, although probably not considered state of the art of Clojure by now...</p></blockquote><p>The dojo format quickly evolved to be less intimidating. Collectively a list of ideas were gathered and voted on and then people split into groups of 3-4 people to solve the winning idea (or doing what ever they wanted in the group). People in each group took turns at the keyboard to write some code.  At the end of the event, each team presented the work they had done and lessons learned (there was no expectation to have something working, but there was lots of REPL based demos).</p><p>Code solutions were encouraged to be shared via the <a href="https://github.com/ldnclj/clork">London Clojurians GitHub organisation</a> so the wider community could learn too.</p><p>Yolina Sotirova hosted the Thoughworks dojo for many many years, laterly supported by Mario Giampietri and a few other willing Thoughtworkers.  Their offices are a few minutes walk from Picadilly Circus in the West End of London.</p><p>Soon after the Thoughworks dojo started a second dojo begain at uSwitch, hosted by Christian Blunden, Aleksander Sumowski and many others.  uSwitch had been using Clojure for a while and it was great learning experience to experiment with them. Mark Mestern and many others help run the uSwitch monthly dojo to this day in their lovely offices just south of Tower Bridge.</p><p>uSwitch and Thoughtworks have been long-term supporters of the code dojo events and after covid they are both running again</p><blockquote><p><a href="https://www.meetup.com/london-clojurians/events/zfckxsyfccbpc/">Thoughtworks Clojure dojo</a> - Last Tuesday of the Month
<a href="https://www.meetup.com/london-clojurians/events/hlsswsyfcdbsb/">uSwitch Clojure dojo</a> - Second Tuesday of the Month</p></blockquote><h2 id="speaking-events">Speaking events</h2><p>A monthly gathering where people shared their experiences or demonstrated work that they had done, including libraries and tools they created.</p><p>This was an in-person event, so speakers and talks were quite London centric (the current online talks have a much broader scope) and the audience was limited.  However, SkillsMatter did record some of the events and they are available to view on their website.</p><blockquote><p><a href="https://skillsmatter.com/explore?q=tag%3Aclojure">Search for videos on SkillsMatter site using the clojure tag</a></p></blockquote><h2 id="clojurex-commercial-conference">ClojureX Commercial Conference</h2><p>Together with SkillsMatter the London Clojurians ran 8 commercial conferences between 2011 and 2018 that attracted over 350 people at its peak.  Community members selected the talks and organised the schedule whilst SkillsMatter organised the venue, catering and sponsorship.</p><p>I had the honour of hosting the last 3 conferences and creating the final schedule of talks to get a smooth flow throughout the two days.</p><p>The conference had a wide audience and many of the people attending were quite new to Clojure, although as people returned each year there were more and more experienced Clojurians there for interesting chats outside the talks.</p><p>Although the conference came to an abrupt end due to SkillsMatter financial difficulties, it served a very valuable role in building up a community and extending the reach of Clojure to other developer communities.  A huge thanks to all the SkillsMatter staff that helped organise the conference</p><ul><li><a href="https://skillsmatter.com/conferences/1145-clojure-exchange#skillscasts">ClojureX 2011</a> - MC Bruce Durling</li><li><a href="https://skillsmatter.com/conferences/1235-clojure-exchange-2012#skillscasts">ClojureX 2012</a> - MC Bruce Durling</li><li><a href="https://skillsmatter.com/conferences/1579-clojure-exchange-2013#skillscasts">ClojureX 2013</a> - MC Bruce Durling</li><li><a href="https://skillsmatter.com/conferences/1956-clojure-exchange-2014#skillscasts">ClojureX 2014</a> - MC Bruce Durling</li><li><a href="https://skillsmatter.com/conferences/6861-clojure-exchange-2015#skillscasts">ClojureX 2015</a> - MC Chris Howe Jones</li><li><a href="https://skillsmatter.com/conferences/7430-clojure-exchange-2016#skillscasts">ClojureX 2016</a> - MC John Stevenson</li><li><a href="https://skillsmatter.com/conferences/8783-clojure-exchange-2017#skillscasts">ClojureX 2017</a> - MC John Stevenson &amp; Yolina Sotirova</li><li><a href="https://skillsmatter.com/conferences/10459-clojure-exchange-2018#skillscasts">ClojureX 2018</a> - MC John Stevenson</li></ul><h2 id="euroclojure">EuroClojure</h2><p>On May 24 &amp; 25 of 2012 London hosted the EuroClojure conference, the first Clojure conference organised by Cognitect outside of the USA.  There were several EuroClojure events that were followed by communities across Europe creating their own events (<a href="https://clojuredays.org/">Dutch Clojure Days</a>, [<a href="https://clojured.de/">ClojureD</a>, <a href="https://heartofclojure.eu/l">Heart of Clojure</a>)</p><p>Many people from the London Clojurians community spoke and there was an excellent range of talks. From the awe inspring musical creations of overtone, engaging talks on CQRS, Cascalog and lossy Data Warehouses, to the inspiring talks from Rich Hickey (who gave two talks in the end).</p><p>250 attendees eagerly listening to 35 talks over the two days and there were many exciting hallway conversations inbetween talks.</p><p><a href="https://vimeo.com/euroclojure">EuroClojure London presentation videos</a></p><p><a href="https://otfrom.wordpress.com/2012/05/27/euroclojure-2012-overview-and-day-one/">Day One</a> and <a href="https://otfrom.wordpress.com/2012/05/28/euroclojure-2012-part-2/">Day Two</a> conference write-ups from Bruce Durling</p><blockquote><p><a href="https://inclojure.org/">IN/Clojure</a> is another community driven conference based in India</p></blockquote><h2 id="increasing-reach">Increasing Reach</h2><p>Whist presenting on Clojure at many other London developer communities I was always asked if there was a Clojure community people could join.  There was a healthy community, but it wasnt very visible.  Events were organised via Eventbrite and posted on the London Clojurians Google mailing list so were hard to find unless already part of the community.</p><p>After discussing with the other organisers, I created a <a href="https://www.meetup.com/london-clojurians/">Meetup.com site for London Clojurians</a> and with in a day we had over 100 members and within a year it was over 1,000 members.  It was much easier for people to find and join in with our events after that.</p><p>I created a <a href="https://github.com/practicalli-john/london-clojurians-logo">logo design for the community</a> to help people recognise our work and gave out free stickers at our events and conferences and any others I spoke at.  This helped raise awarness of the community and increased membership on the meetup site.</p><p>A Website was also developed using ClojureScript and used as one of the learning paths for the London ClojureBridge events.</p><p>I also had the chance to give Clojure talks and workshops across Europe (Germany, The Netherlands, Italy) and the USA (San Francisco), helping spread interest far and wide.</p><blockquote><p>twitter account (probably should create a mastodon account)</p></blockquote><h2 id="hack-the-tower--clojure-workshops">Hack the tower &amp; Clojure workshops</h2><p>After a successful Hack day at the Guardian offices and an enlightening <a href="https://jr0cket.co.uk/2012/02/developers-making-music-together-london.html.html">Clojure Hackday at thoughtworks</a>, I decided to create a regular Hack day called <a href="https://hacktogetherldn.github.io/">Hack The Tower</a>.  The event was scheduled in the Clojure, Java and Scala communities (as I had been helping to organise events for them) and open to anyone else that wanted to come really.</p><p>I was working at Heroku/Salesforce offices in Tower 42 (hence Hack The Tower name for the event) and realised no one used their offices on the weekend, so got permission to run a Saturday even ever month (ensuring the building security staff were happy).</p><p>I was quite surprised when 20+ people turned up on a chilly November day (28th to co-inside with International day-of-code).  Much fun and knowledge sharing was happening as we worked together on ideas in small groups.  We even had some <a href="https://youtu.be/rJnjmwtGQuE">robots to control with code</a>. Not even the faint smell of stale coffee left by the sales teams the day before stopped people enjoying themselves.</p><p>The event had a reboot when Salesforce moved into floor 26, 27 &amp; 28 of the Heron Tower (Salesforce Tower).  This was a beautiful and large office space which easily held over 100 people for a hack day.</p><blockquote><p><a href="https://jr0cket.co.uk/2013/02/hack-tower-february-2013.html">Hack The Tower writeup - February 2013</a> - jr0cket blog</p></blockquote><p>Hack The Tower ran every month for 5 years whilst I was at Salesforce and food was sponsored by Salesforce (and carried in several super-size bags from Tescos by myself each time - so a bit of exercise for me)</p><blockquote><p>Another  bit of exercise to chase down everyone at the end of the day across all the many rooms, ensuring I was the last too leave :)</p></blockquote><p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/practicalli/graphic-design/live/events/hack-the-tower-view-rainbow.png" alt="View from Hack The Tower event - London Salesforce offices" /></p><h2 id="clojurebridge-london">ClojureBridge London</h2><p>uSwitch ran the first ClojureBridge London event in February 2014 with about 8 organisers who had no experience in how to run such an event (or what it should look like).  Thanks to Anna Pawlicka we manage to get organised and ran a very successful event for 38 people, with about 10 volunteers on the day.</p><p>There has always been a very mixed audience at each event, from those who have never written code before to those with some professional experience (but no Clojure experience).  Attendees were put into groups of 3-5 people with one or more voluneers as their guide through Clojure.</p><p>Initially the clojurebridge.org content was used, although after the first event we started to extend and enhance the learning materials.  I did a lot of work to create <a href="https://clojurebridgelondon.github.io/#learning-paths">specific learning paths and engaging exercises</a> for students at different levels of experience.  Work that motivated me to create the Practicalli series of on line books.</p><p>GeekGirls Scotland ran a ClojureBridge event on September 27th 2014 at CodeBase in Edinburgh.</p><p>I wasn involved in organising all 13 events over the last 8 years...  https://clojurebridgelondon.github.io/organise-clojurebridge-london/</p><p><a href="https://clojurebridgelondon.github.io/">ClojureBridge London website</a></p><h2 id="going-online">Going Online</h2><p>The Practicalli YouTube channel had proved popular and taking the talks online had been suggested many times over the years to increase the pool of speakers.</p><p>Bruno Bonacci took the initiative and started organising the virtual presentations and they really took off, so much more than we could do with in-person events.  Bruno has done an amazing job of organising a huge list of diverse topics and speakers.  Thank you.</p><p>All the videos are uploaded to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/london-clojurians">London Clojurains YouTube Channel</a> that I set up and delegated ownership to Renzo Borgatti.</p><h2 id="supporting-activities">Supporting activities</h2><p>Many companies and individuals ask if they could sponsor the community over the years, but most of the community ran with no actual costs as all the work was done on a volunteer basis.</p><p>Thoughworks and uSwitch hosting (and providing refreshments) for the dojos and SkillsMatter hosted the talks and conferences (which many companies did sponsor, although that was directly to SkillsMatter).</p><p>When London Clojurians started reClojure conference though, there was a need for financial help.  The conference was free to attend, so the venue, catering and filming created costs.</p><p>I suggested to Renzo Borgatti and Bruno Bonacci that we start the <a href="https://opencollective.com/london-clojurians">London Clojurains Open Collective</a> as a completely transparent way for anyone to financially support the community.  Either for specific events like reClojure or in general to help the community to do much more.</p><p>The financial support has taken the burdon of volunteers to pay for essential tools such as Meetup.com and Zoom video conference, which had previously been paid by those managing those services.</p><p>The community uses freely available services where possible, e.g GitHub for code sharing and GitHub pages to host websites and learning materials.</p><p>youtube
